Here's a detailed Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) design tailored for your power-aware DDoS detection problem on the UAV's Raspberry Pi:

## DFA Components for the Power-Aware DDoS-RL System

### 1. **States (Q)**

Each state represents a unique system condition defined by:

- **Threat State: Normal (N), Confirming (C), Confirmed (F)**
- **Battery Level: 5 discrete bins (B0: 0-20%, B1: 21-40%, B2: 41-60%, B3: 61-80%, B4: 81-100%)**
- **Temperature Level: 3 discrete bins (T0: Safe, T1: Warning, T2: Critical)**

The DFA states are all combinations of these:

$$
Q = \{(Threat, Battery, Temp)\ |\ Threat \in \{N,C,F\},\ Battery \in \{B0,...,B4\},\ Temp \in \{T0,T1,T2\}\}
$$

Total states = 3 (threat) × 5 (battery) × 3 (temperature) = **45 states**

***

### 2. **Alphabet (Σ)**

Events that cause state transitions:

- **Threat_Response Change:**
  - $$e_1$$: Normal → Confirming  
  - $$e_2$$: Confirming → Confirmed  
  - $$e_3$$: Confirmed → Normal  
  - $$e_4$$: Confirming → Normal  
  - $$e_5$$: Normal → Normal (no change)  
  - $$e_6$$: Confirmed → Confirmed (no change)

- **Battery Change:**
  - $$b_0, b_1, ..., b_4$$ for updated battery bins

- **Temperature Change:**
  - $$t_0, t_1, t_2$$ for updated temperature bins

***

### 3. **Transition Function (δ)**

$$
\delta: Q \times Σ \to Q
$$

Defines deterministic transitions based on events:

- **Threat changes update the Threat component of state.**
- **Battery or temperature change events update those components respectively.**

Example Transition:

$$
\delta((N, B2, T0), e_1) = (C, B2, T0) \quad \text{(Threat Normal→Confirming)}
$$

$$
\delta((C, B2, T0), b_1) = (C, B1, T0) \quad \text{(Battery changes from B2 to B1)}
$$

***

### 4. **Start State (q₀)**

Initial system state, e.g.,

$$
q_0 = (N, B4, T0) \quad \text{(Normal threat, max battery, safe temp)}
$$

***

### 5. **Accepting States (F)**

Not applicable in classic sense, but states representing:

- Safe operation (No DDoS or XGBoost running)
- Confirmed threat states requiring TST or XGBoost depending on battery and temperature

***

### 6. **Output Function (λ) — Algorithm Action**

For each state $$q \in Q$$, output action:

| Threat | Battery | Temp | Action (0=No DDoS,1=XGBoost,2=TST) | 
|--------|---------|------|-----------------------------------|
| **N**ormal | B0 or any | Any | 0 (No DDoS) |
| **N**       | B1+ | T2 (Critical) | 0 (No DDoS) |
| **N**       | B1+ | T0 or T1 | 1 (XGBoost) |
| **C**onfirming | B0 | Any | 0 (No DDoS) |
| **C**         | B1 or B2 | T2 | 1 (XGBoost) |
| **C**         | B1 or B2 | T0/T1 | 2 (TST) |
| **C**        | B3 or B4 | T0/T1 | 2 (TST) |
| **F** (Confirmed) | B0 or Any | T2 | 0 (No DDoS) |
| **F** (Confirmed) | B1+ | T0/T1 | 1 (XGBoost) |

## Summary Diagram Representation:

```
[State: (N, B4, T0)] --e1--> [State: (C, B4, T0)] --b_2--> [State: (C, B2, T0)] --t_2--> [State: (C, B2, T2)]
  |                                |                               |                             |
 Action: 1                     Action: 2                      Action: 2                   Action: 1 (due to T2)
 (XGBoost)                   (TST)                          (TST)                      (No DDoS due to Critical Temp)
```

## Benefits of This DFA Model:

- **Deterministic:** Easy to understand and debug.
- **Event-Driven:** State changes only upon observed events; low overhead.
- **Clear State-Action Mapping:** Simple lookup from state to action.
- **Modular:** Can be extended with more battery or temperature bins.
- **Safety First:** Encodes hardware-critical protections deterministically.
